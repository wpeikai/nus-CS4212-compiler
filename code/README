** Included:
  code/
     MakeFile
     jlite_main.ml ... jlite_toir3.ml     From previous assignments
     ir3_to_arm.ml            Optimized version of IR3 to ARM generation
     optimize_arm.ml          ARM-specific optimizations
     jlite_main_non_optim.ml  Non-optimized version of IR3 to ARM generation
     ir3_to_arm_non_optim.ml
     test/                    Test example Jlite prgrams


** Instructions:
  1. Set up g++, etc as directed in the assignment handout. 

  2. Make the Android toolchain as specified in the project assignment document.
     This has to be done every time the computer is rebooted.

  3. Launch the Android emulator via 'sh launch_emu.ml'. Our emulator was for
     Android v4.4 and named Compiler.
  
  4. Use 'make' to run the compiler. It runs the compiler to parse and generate
     the ARM machine code files from files with the '.jlite' extension found in
     the test folder. Each file is then executed on the emulator using adb shell
     from the Android SDK.

     make             Optimized compiler
     make noptim      Unoptimized compiler
     make clean       Clean

     NOTE: In order for the compiler to work, the emulator (and thus the
           computer) must be online.
